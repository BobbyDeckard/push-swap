Check errors on parsing
Make sure program quits properly (without leaks) when an error occurs

Check differences between simple and double pointers on structs (eg: in last_node, is it really necessary to make a temporay pointer?)
-->
So, don't need to make subsidiary pointers inside a function, makes sense as the pointer's scope is limited to the function in which it is called

Find a way to ensure no argument bigger than an int gets treated
